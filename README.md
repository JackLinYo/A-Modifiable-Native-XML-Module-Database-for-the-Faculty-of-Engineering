# A-Modifiable-Native-XML-Module-Database-for-the-Faculty-of-Engineering
 This project aims to design and build up a system, which allows the user to extract and search the data from the hierarchical structure of XML document. The data is based on the module information under the Faculty of Engineering because it contains different majors, and each major provides a variety of module information. Considering software requirement to build this system, XML Parser chose, web technologies and algorithms have been implemented. DOM Parser has the ability to parse the XML document into a hierarchical DOM tree structure. To combine with PHP, it will be possible to define algorithms in order to traverse the DOM tree,   and extract or search a specific tree node by accessing a particular branch. Finally, the results can be displayed in user interfaces, which were built up by using HTML5 &amp; CSS3.
